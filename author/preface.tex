\chapter{Preface}
This is a book for dummies who want to read but cannot understand Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS.\\
Everything is taken directly from that book or paraphrased.\\
All the details that you are not going to remember even if you read the original book are omitted. \\
I find the pseudocode really hard to read and that arrays start with 1 instead of 0 really anti-intuitive. So 
I just write everything in a syntax I came up that I find most easy to read, and I index arrays start with 0.
